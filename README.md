# iba-data
Data from the Insect Biome Atlas project, supported by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and running 2018-2024.

This repo contains smaller primary data sets, code for processing data in various ways, and other resources that are useful for users of the main datasets from the Insect Biome Atlas (IBA) project.

The repo is a complement to the main data files---the raw ASV sequence and sample count files---which are stored on FigShare. These files are too large to store meaningfully on GitHub. They are also essentially permanent, so that it makes little sense to store them under a version control system.

Tagging of particular versions/commits to the repo will be used to refer effectively from publications coming out of the IBA project to specific versions of processed data files or data processing code.
